        The Danish Tax Calculator is a tool designed to help individuals
        estimate their tax liabilities in Denmark accurately. Given Denmark's
        progressive tax system, including labor market contributions, and
        various deductions, calculating taxes can be complex. This project
        simplifies the process by providing an automated, user-friendly
        solution.
